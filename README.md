# Ticket Management Web App

This repository contains three separate, complete frontend implementations (React, Vue.js, and Twig) of a robust ticket management web application.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate mastery in structuring frontend applications, state management, form logic, and UI design by building the exact same application with three distinct technologies. All versions adhere to a strict set of requirements, including a uniform layout, design language, and user experience.

## Core Features

- **Multi-Framework Implementation:** The same UI/UX built three times from scratch using:
    - **React.js**
    - **Vue.js**
    - **Twig** (with a minimal PHP backend for rendering)
- **Welcoming Landing Page:** A visually appealing hero section featuring a distinctive wavy SVG background, decorative circles, and clear "Login" / "Get Started" calls-to-action.
- **Secure Authentication:** A complete Login and Signup flow with client-side validation, toast/snackbar notifications, and simulated session management using `localStorage` (react and vue).
- **Protected Routes:** The Dashboard and Ticket Management pages are secured. Unauthorized users are automatically redirected to the login page.
- **High-Level Dashboard:** Displays key summary statistics and provides clear navigation.
- **Full CRUD Functionality:** A complete ticket management screen to Create, Read, Update, and Delete tickets.
- **Robust Validation:** Enforces mandatory fields and strict value rules.
- **Clear User Feedback:** Provides inline error messages and toast notifications for all form actions, API errors, and authentication status changes.
- **Consistent & Responsive Design:** The UI is fully responsive and adheres to a strict design guide (1440px max-width, consistent colors, shadows, and layout) across all three versions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

    - **Framework:** Vue 3 (Composition API)
    - **Routing:** Vue Router
    - **Styling:** Scoped CSS (or Tailwind)
    - **Notifications:** `vue-toastification`

## Vue Live Demo

 **3. Twig Implementation (`/twig-app/`)**
    - **Framework:** Symfony
    - **Templating:** Twig
    - **Backend (for rendering):** A minimal **PHP** application (using `composer` for dependencies).
    - **Frontend Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (for form validation and interactivity)

## Run Locally

Follow these instructions to clone the project and run each implementation locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your machine:

* **Node.js** (v18 or later) & **npm** / **yarn** (for React and Vue)
* **PHP** (v8.0 or later) (for the Twig version)
* **Composer** (PHP package manager) (for the Twig version)
* **Git**

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/throwAway-sus/HNG-internship.git
    cd HNG-internship
    ```
## Running Each Implementation
    
1. if react or vue, navigate to their given folder:
   ```
    cd vue-implementation or cd react-inplementation
    ```
2.  Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser and visit the URL provided in your terminal (usually **`http://localhost:5173`**).

### Running the Twig Version (Locally)

The Twig version requires PHP and Composer to serve the templates.
